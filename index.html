  <h3>
    At SportStake, we believe Sports betting should be easy, trustworthy AND anonymous! Which is why we
    use Stablecoin <a href="https://oasis.app/">DAI</a> by <a href="https://makerdao.com">MakerDAO</a> as our currency of choice, to enable "Decentralized Sports Betting"! At SportStake, your Ethereum address is the only "ID" we need, you never "deposit" funds into an account, payouts are processed same day, and as simple as hitting the "claim" button.
